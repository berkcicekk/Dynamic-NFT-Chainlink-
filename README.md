# Dynamic-NFT-Chainlink-
Dynamic-NFT | Chainlink is a project aiming to push the boundaries of NFTs by introducing dynamic elements that can change over time, powered by real-world data accessed through Chainlink oracles. This integration allows NFTs to evolve beyond static digital assets, making them responsive to external factors and more functional.
